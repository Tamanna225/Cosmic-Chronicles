                    <div class="theory-content">
                        The Chandrayaan-2 mission was successfully launched on 22nd July 2019 at 14:43 hrs by GSLV MkIII-M1 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota. After a series of Earth bound manoeuvres, the spacecraft entered into Lunar Transfer Trajectory (LTT) on August 14th. Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) manoeuvre was performed on August 20th, thereby Chandrayaan-2 was successfully inserted into the elliptical orbit around the Moon. This was followed by a series of Lunar bound orbit maneuvers for reducing the orbit to circular polar orbit around the Moon. <br><br>
                        Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter is currently in a 100 km x 100 km orbit around the Moon On September 2nd, Vikram lander separated from the Orbiter and de-orbiting maneuver was performed to reduce the orbit to 35 km x 101 km. Vikram landing was attempted on 7th September and it followed the planned descent trajectory from its orbit of 35 km to around 2 km above the surface. Communication with lander and ground station was lost. All the systems and sensors of the Lander functioned excellently until this point and proved many new technologies such as variable thrust propulsion technology used in the Lander. However, the Orbiter is healthy and all the payloads are operational. <br><br>
                        Chandrayaan-2 carried eight experiment payload on board for studying surface geology, composition and exospheric measurements of Moon. These measurements will continue to enhance upon the understanding built from previous lunar missions.

                    <div class="theory-content">
                        The Chandrayaan-2 mission, launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 2019, aimed to significantly expand our knowledge of the Moon, particularly focusing on its unexplored south polar region. Here's a breakdown of its primary objectives:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Unraveling the Lunar South Pole: <br>
                                Chandrayaan-2 targeted the lunar south pole, a region shrouded in mystery due to its permanent shadows and extreme temperatures. The mission aimed to study the composition and characteristics of this previously unexplored territory.
                            </li>
                            <li>Lunar Water Hunt: <br>
                                A major objective was to search for water ice deposits in the permanently shadowed craters at the south pole. The presence of water ice on the Moon has significant implications for future lunar exploration and potential resource utilization. Instruments onboard the mission were specifically designed to detect water signatures.
                            </li>
                            <li> Lunar Surface Mapping and Composition Analysis: <br>
                                The mission carried scientific instruments to map the lunar surface in detail, focusing on the south pole. Studying the topography and composition of this region could provide valuable insights into the Moon's geological history and evolution.
                            </li>
                            <li>Lunar Seismic Activity Investigation: <br>
                                Chandrayaan-2 aimed to establish a seismic station on the lunar surface to detect and measure moonquakes. Understanding lunar seismic activity could shed light on the Moon's internal structure and geological processes.
                            </li>
                            <li>Technological Advancement: <br>
                                The mission served as a platform to demonstrate and validate India's technological capabilities in spacecraft design, navigation, soft landing on the Moon, and robotic exploration.
                            </li> <br>
                            While the lander Vikram unfortunately didn't achieve a soft landing, the orbiter continues to successfully send valuable data and images of the Moon back to Earth, contributing to the mission's scientific objectives.

                            <p>The Mars Colour Camera is a versatile and multi-purpose snap shot camera with R-G-B Bayer pattern to map various morphological features on Mars and return visual images of Mars and its environs. Besides providing context information for other payloads, MCC is also expected to observe and help in furthering our understanding of events like dust storms, dust devils etc. that are known to occur in Mars. The highly elliptical orbit of the current mission allows imaging of localized scenes at high spatial resolution as well as provides a synoptic view of the full globe. This payload is developed by Space Application Centre Ahmedabad.</p>

                        The Chandrayaan-1 mission, India's first lunar exploration endeavor, achieved several remarkable feats that solidified its place as a significant milestone in space exploration. Here's a breakdown of its key achievements:

                            <li>The Hyper Spectral Imager (HySI) provided valuable data to create a mineralogical map of the lunar surface, aiding in identifying the various minerals present.</li>
                            <li>The Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument (LLRI) measured the distance between the spacecraft and the Moon with high precision, contributing to a more accurate lunar elevation map and studies of the Moon's internal structure.</li>

                    <div class="theory-content">
                        The Chandrayaan-1 mission, India's first lunar foray, yielded several groundbreaking scientific results that significantly impacted our understanding of the Moon. Here are the major highlights:   
                        <ul>
                            <li>Detection of Water Molecules: <br>
                                This stands as one of the mission's most significant achievements. Instruments like the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) and the Moon Impact Probe's Chorda instrument provided evidence for the presence of water molecules (H2O) and hydroxyl (OH) deposits on the lunar surface, particularly in permanently shadowed craters. This challenged the long-held belief of a completely dry Moon and sparked further research into the existence and distribution of lunar water ice.
                            </li>
                            <li>Confirmation of Lunar Magma Ocean Hypothesis: <br>
                                The NASA instrument, Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), aboard Chandrayaan-1, confirmed the long-standing hypothesis of a Lunar Magma Ocean. This theory suggests that the Moon was once entirely molten, with heavier elements sinking to the core and lighter elements forming the crust as the Moon cooled. M3's data on the abundance of specific minerals provided strong evidence to support this hypothesis.
                            </li>
                            <li>Detailed Lunar Surface Mapping: <br>
                                The Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC) and the Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument (LLRI) played a crucial role in creating highly detailed 3D maps of the lunar surface. TMC captured high-resolution images, offering a comprehensive view of the Moon's topography on both the near and far sides. LLRI's precise distance measurements contributed to a more accurate lunar elevation map.
