                    <h4>Neptune, named after the Roman god of the sea, is the farthest known planet from the Sun.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass: Approximately 17 times that of Earth</li>
                        <li>Diameter: With an equatorial diameter of 30,775 miles (49,528 kilometers), Neptune is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball.</li>
                        <li>Temperature: Ranges from -218 to -200 degrees Celsius</li>
                        <li>Distance: Average distance from the Sun about 2.795 billion miles</li>
                        <li>Gravity: About 1.14 times Earth's gravity</li>
                        <li>Rings: Neptune has at least five main rings and four prominent ring arcs that we know of so far. Starting near the planet and moving outward, the main rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago, and Adams. The rings are thought to be relatively young and short-lived.</li>
                        <li>Speed: Orbits the Sun at about 5.43 km/s</li>
                        <li>Shape: Neptune is an oblate spheroid. It bulges slightly at the equator due to its rotation.</li>
                        <li>Moons: Neptune has 16 known moons, with the largest one being Triton, which is even larger than Pluto. These moons orbit Neptune in a variety of directions, with some even having retrograde orbits (opposite Neptune's rotation).</li>
                        <li>Rotation Speed: Neptune rotates on its axis quite quickly, completing one full rotation in about 16 hours and 6 minutes. This rapid rotation contributes to its oblate shape.</li>
                        <li>Revolution Speed: a year on Neptune, measured by its revolution around the Sun (sidereal year), is much longer than an Earth year. It takes Neptune a whopping 165 Earth years to complete one full orbit around the Sun. This makes Neptune the farthest planet from the Sun and the one with the longest year in our solar system.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Neptune's atmosphere is composed of hydrogen, helium, and traces of methane, giving it a vivid blue coloration.</li>
                        <li>The planet's largest moon, Triton, orbits in a retrograde direction and may have been captured from the Kuiper Belt.</li>
                        <li>Neptune experiences extreme wind speeds, with the fastest recorded winds in the solar system observed in its atmosphere.</li>
                        <li>Its dynamic atmosphere features dark spots, bright clouds, and atmospheric phenomena, hinting at complex weather patterns and internal dynamics.</li>
