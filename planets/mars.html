                    <h4>Mars, often called the "Red Planet," has captured human imagination as a potential destination for exploration and colonization.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass: Approximately 0.107 times that of Earth. It would take more than 6 of mars to fill the volume of Earth.</li>
                        <li>Diameter: 6792km</li>
                        <li>Temperature: Ranges from -140 to 20 degrees Celsius</li>
                        <li>Distance: Average distance from the Sun about 141.6 million miles</li>
                        <li>Gravity: About 38% of Earth's gravity. On Mars, you'd experience 62% less gravity than you're used to.</li>
                        <li>Speed: Orbits the Sun at about 24.077 km/s</li>
                        <li>Shape: Mars is an oblate spheroid, bulging slightly at the equator and flattened at the poles due to its rotation.</li>
                        <li>Moons: Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are much smaller and more irregular in shape than Earth's moon.</li>
                        <li>Rotation Speed: Mars rotates on its axis in about 24.6 hours, which is slightly longer than a day on Earth. A day on Mars is called a sol.</li>
                        <li>Revolution Speed: Mars takes significantly longer to orbit the Sun than Earth. It completes one revolution every 687 Earth days (about 2 Earth years).</li>
                        <br>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>Mars is home to the largest volcano and the deepest canyon in the solar system: Olympus Mons and Valles Marineris, respectively.</li>
                        <li>Evidence suggests that liquid water flowed on Mars' surface in the past, indicating the potential for ancient habitability.</li>
                        <li>The planet's thin atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon, hindering its ability to support life.</li>
                        <li>Mars has polar ice caps consisting of water and carbon dioxide ice, which may hold clues about its past climate and water history.</li>
