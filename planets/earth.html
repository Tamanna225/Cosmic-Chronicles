                    <h4>Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only known planet to support life.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass: Approximately 5.972 x 10^24 kg</li>
                        <li>Diameter: 12760km</li>
                        <li>Temperature: Ranges from -89 to 57 degrees Celsius</li>
                        <li>Distance: Average distance from the Sun about 93 million miles (150 million km) </li>
                        <li>Gravity: About 9.8 m/sÂ²</li>
                        <li>Rings: Earth has no rings.</li>
                        <li>Speed: Orbits the Sun at about 29.78 km/s</li>
                        <li>Shape: Earth is not actually round. It bulges slightly at the equator and is flattened at the poles due to the centrifugal force caused by its rotation. This shape is called an oblate spheroid.</li>
                        <li>Moon: Earth has a single moon, which is relatively large compared to the size of the planet. The moon is thought to have formed about 4.5 billion years ago when a Mars-sized object collided with Earth.</li>
                        <li>Rotational speed: Earth takes about 23.5 hours to complete one rotation on its axis. This is why we have a day and night cycle.</li>
                        <li>Revolution speed: Earth takes about 365.25 days to complete one revolution around the sun. This is why we have a year. The extra quarter-day is why we have leap years every four years.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Its diverse surface includes mountains, oceans, and forests, making it ideal for life to thrive.</li>
                        <li>Earth's atmosphere consists of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and trace gases, creating the perfect conditions for life.</li>
                        <li>The planet's magnetic field protects it from harmful solar radiation, allowing life to flourish on its surface.</li>
                        <li>Earth's geology is shaped by processes such as erosion, plate tectonics, and volcanic activity, contributing to its dynamic and ever-changing landscape.</li>
