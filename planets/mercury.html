                    <h4>Mercury, the smallest planet in the solar system, is also the closest to the Sun.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass: Approximately 0.055 times that of Earth</li>
                        <li>Diameter: 4879km</li>
                        <li>Temperature: Ranges from -173 to 427 degrees Celsius</li>
                        <li>Distance: Average distance from the Sun about 36 million miles</li>
                        <li>Gravity: About 38% of Earth's gravity</li>  
                        <li>Rings: Mercury doesn't have rings</li>
                        <li>Speed: Orbits the Sun at about 47.87 km/s</li>
                        <li>Shape: Mercury is an oblate spheroid. This means it bulges slightly at the equator and is flattened at the poles due to its rotation.</li>
                        <li>Moons: Mercury is the only planet in our solar system without any known moons. Scientists believe strong tidal forces from the Sun would have disrupted or prevented any moon formation or capture.</li>
                        <li>Rotation Speed:  Here's where things get interesting. A day on Mercury (solar day) is much longer than a day on Earth, even longer than a year on Mercury. A solar day, the time from sunrise to sunrise, takes a lengthy 176 Earth days due to Mercury's slow rotation and egg-shaped orbit. However, a sidereal day, which is one full rotation on its axis, is only 58 Earth days.</li>
                        <li>Revolution speed: Mercury takes 88 Earth days to complete one revolution, which is shorter than a solar day on Mercury</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Despite its small size, Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations and has a surface covered in craters.</li>
                        <li>Its orbit is the most eccentric of all the planets, leading to significant temperature differences between its day and night sides.</li>
                        <li>Mercury's thin atmosphere consists mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium, making it unable to support life as we know it.</li>
