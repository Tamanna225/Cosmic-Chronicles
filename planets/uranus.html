                    <h4>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is an ice giant with unique features such as its sideways rotation.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass: Approximately 14.5 times that of Earth</li>
                        <li>Diameter: With an equatorial diameter of 31,763 miles (51,118 kilometers), Uranus is four times wider than Earth. If Earth was the size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.</li>
                        <li>Temperature: Ranges from -224 to -197 degrees Celsius</li>
                        <li>Distance: Average distance from the Sun about 1.784 billion miles</li>
                        <li>Gravity: About 0.886 times Earth's gravity</li>
                        <li>Rings: Uranus has two sets of rings. The inner system of nine rings consists mostly of narrow, dark grey rings. There are two outer rings: the innermost one is reddish like dusty rings elsewhere in the solar system, and the outer ring is blue like Saturn's E ring.</li>
                        <li>Speed: Orbits the Sun at about 6.81 km/s</li>
                        <li>Shape: Uranus is an oblate spheroid, meaning it bulges slightly at the equator and is flattened at the poles due to its rotation.</li>
                        <li>Moons: Uranus has 28 known moons, named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope's works. Some, like Titania and Oberon, have their own atmospheres.</li>
                        <li>Rotation speed: Uranus rotates on its axis very quickly, completing a full rotation in about 17 hours and 14 minutes. Due to its tilted axis, a "day" on Uranus can vary depending on location. At the equator, a day is slightly shorter than Earth's at about 17 hours. At the poles, a day can last for years.</li>
                        <li>Revolution speed: Uranus takes a much longer time to orbit the Sun than Earth. It completes one revolution every 84 Earth years.</li>
                        <li>Namesake: William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the planet was named for Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Uranus' axial tilt of about 98 degrees causes it to essentially roll on its side as it orbits the Sun, leading to extreme seasonal variations.</li>
                        <li>The planet's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it a blue-green hue.</li>
                        <li>Uranus has a system of faint rings and 28 known moons, the largest of which is Miranda, known for its diverse and geologically young surface.</li>
