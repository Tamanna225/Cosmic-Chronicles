                    <h4>The Sun, our star, formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age: The Sun is estimated to be about 4.6 billion years old.</li>
                        <li>Energy Source: The Sun's energy is generated through nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms are fused into helium, releasing tremendous amounts of light and heat.</li>
                        <li>Mass: Approximately 330,000 times that of Earth</li>
                        <li>Temperature: Surface temperature about 5,500 degrees Celsius</li>
                        <li>Distance: Average distance from Earth about 93 million miles</li>
                        <li>Gravity: Strong enough to hold the solar system together</li>
                        <li>Speed: Orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy at about 220 km/s</li>
                        <li>Shape: The Sun is a giant ball of hot plasma, not a solid body like a planet. Due to its immense gravity and rotation, it bulges slightly at the equator, making it an oblate spheroid.</li>
                        <li>Moons: The Sun doesn't have moons in the traditional sense. However, it does have a retinue of objects gravitationally bound to it, including eight major planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and dust.</li>
                        <li>Rotation Speed: The Sun rotates on its axis, but not uniformly. The equator rotates faster than the poles due to its fluid nature. The average rotation period at the equator is about 25 days.</li>
                        <li>There's no concept of a "solar year" as the Sun doesn't revolve around another object.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The Sun's energy is generated through nuclear fusion reactions, powering life on Earth and driving the dynamics of the solar system.</li>
                        <li>Solar flares and sunspots are phenomena observed on the Sun's surface, impacting space weather and communication systems on Earth.</li>
                        <li>Scientists study the Sun to understand its influence on Earth's climate, space weather, and the potential for renewable energy sources.</li>
