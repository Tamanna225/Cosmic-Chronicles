                    <h4>Saturn, famous for its stunning ring system, is the second-largest planet in the solar system and sixth planet from the sun.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass: Approximately 95 times that of Earth</li>
                        <li>Diameter: With an equatorial diameter of about 74,897 miles (120,500 kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Saturn would be about as big as a volleyball.</li>
                        <li>Temperature: Ranges from -185 to -122 degrees Celsius</li>
                        <li>Distance: Average distance from the Sun about 886 million miles</li>
                        <li>Gravity: About 1.07 times Earth's gravity</li>
                        <li>Rings: The rings would look mostly white if you looked at them from the cloud tops of Saturn, and interestingly, each ring orbits at a different speed around the planet.</li>
                        <li>Speed: Orbits the Sun at about 9.69 km/s</li>
                        <li>Shape: Saturn is an oblate spheroid. It bulges slightly at the equator due to its rapid rotation.</li>
                        <li>Moons: Saturn boasts the most moons of any planet in our solar system, with a confirmed count of 146 moons and more likely waiting to be discovered. These moons range in size from tiny moonlets to Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system after Jupiter's Ganymede.</li>
                        <li>Rotation Speed: Saturn spins quite fast on its axis, completing one full rotation in just about 10.5 hours. This rapid rotation is a major factor contributing to its oblate shape.</li>
                        <li>Revolution Speed: A year on Saturn, measured by its revolution around the Sun is much longer than an Earth year. It takes Saturn roughly 29.4 Earth years to complete one full orbit around the Sun.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Saturn's rings are made up of icy particles ranging in size from micrometers to meters, orbiting the planet's equator.</li>
                        <li>The planet's unique hexagonal storm at its north pole and intricate cloud patterns make it a subject of scientific inquiry and wonder.</li>
                        <li>Saturn has over 80 moons, with Titan being the largest and notable for its thick atmosphere and hydrocarbon lakes.</li>
                        <li>Its composition includes hydrogen and helium, with traces of other elements, giving it the lowest density of all the planets in the solar system.</li>
