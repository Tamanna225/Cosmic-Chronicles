                        <li>Distance: Average distance from Earth about 384,400 kilometers</li>
                        <li>Gravity: About 1.62 m/s²</li>
                        <li>Speed: Orbits the Earth at about 1 km/s</li>
                        <li>Shape: The Moon is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid, slightly bulging at its equator due to the tidal forces exerted by Earth.</li>
                        <li>Moons: The Moon is itself a moon of Earth and has no natural moons of its own.</li>
                        <li>Rotation Speed: The Moon's rotation period is tidally locked with Earth's revolution period. This means it takes the Moon the same amount of time to rotate on its axis as it does to orbit Earth (roughly 27.3 Earth days). As a result, the same side of the Moon always faces Earth, while the far side remains permanently hidden.</li>
                        <li>Revolution Speed: The Moon takes about one month to orbit Earth (27.3 days to complete a revolution, but 29.5 days to change from New Moon to New Moon).</li>

                    This is the invisible phase of the Moon, with the illuminated side of the Moon facing the Sun and the night side facing Earth. In this phase, the Moon is in the same part of the sky as the Sun and rises and sets with the Sun. Not only is the illuminated side facing away from the Earth, it's also up during the day! Remember, in this phase, the Moon doesn't usually pass directly between Earth and the Sun, due to the inclination of the Moon's orbit. It only passes near the Sun from our perspective on Earth. While the new moon appears close to the Sun from our perspective, it doesn't usually pass exactly between Earth and the Sun due to the Moon's orbital tilt. A perfect alignment can lead to a solar eclipse, where the Moon briefly blocks the Sun's light.
                    Tides are weaker (neap tides) due to the Sun and Moon's gravitational pulls partially canceling each other out.
                    It marks the start of a new lunar cycle (around 29.5 days) with changing Moon phases.
                    Many cultures associate it with new beginnings, renewal, or rituals.

                <div class="moon-info">
                    This silver of a Moon occurs when the illuminated half of the Moon faces mostly away from Earth, with only a tiny portion visible to us from our planet. It grows daily as the Moon's orbit carries the Moon's dayside farther into view. Every day, the Moon rises a little bit later. The waxing crescent represents the Moon's transition from the new moon phase towards the first quarter. As the Moon continues its orbit, the visible crescent will become progressively larger and thicker, eventually reaching a half-illuminated state (first quarter). While less pronounced than during a full moon, the waxing crescent moon still influences Earth's tides. The combined gravitational pulls of the Sun and Moon during this phase create a slight bulge in the oceans, leading to tides that are higher than neap tides (new moon) but lower than spring tides (full moon). The waxing crescent moon provides some illumination in the night sky, but it's significantly less than a full moon. This can be a good time for observing faint stars or deep-sky objects that might be obscured by a brighter full moon.

                <div class="moon-info">
                    The Moon is now a quarter of the way through its monthly journey and you see half of its illuminated side. People may casually call this a half moon, but remember, that's not really what you're witnessing in the sky. You're seeing just a slice of the entire Moon ― half of the illuminated half. A first quarter moon rises around noon and sets around midnight. It's high in the sky in the evening and makes for excellent viewing. The dividing line between the illuminated and dark portions of the Moon during the first quarter is called the terminator line. This line represents the sunrise or sunset line on the lunar surface depending on which side you're observing. During this phase, the Earth, Moon, and Sun form a right angle (90 degrees) in space. This specific alignment is what creates the precise half-illuminated appearance of the Moon from our Earthly perspective. Compared to other phases, the first quarter moon has a moderate influence on Earth's tides. It creates a tidal bulge less pronounced than a full moon but more noticeable than a new moon.

                <div class="moon-info">
                    Now most of the Moon's dayside has come into view, and the Moon appears brighter in the sky. Unlike the first quarter (precisely half-illuminated), the waxing gibbous moon appears "gibbous," meaning its illuminated area is more extensive than half, but not quite a full circle. It has a somewhat "humped" appearance. Similar to the first quarter, the waxing gibbous moon exhibits a terminator line dividing the illuminated and dark regions. However, in this phase, the terminator appears more curved due to the larger illuminated area. With a significantly brighter surface compared to earlier phases, the waxing gibbous moon offers excellent viewing conditions. Craters, maria (dark plains), and even mountain ranges become more prominent and easier to distinguish, especially with binoculars or a telescope.

                    This is as close as we come to seeing the Sun's illumination of the entire day side of the Moon (so, technically, this would be the real half moon). The Moon is opposite the Sun, as viewed from Earth, revealing the Moon's dayside. A full moon rises around sunset and sets around sunrise. The Moon will appear full for a couple of days before it moves into. Unlike some other phases, earthshine is not typically visible on the full moon because the entire day side is brightly illuminated by the Sun. The full moon occurs when the Earth lies directly between the Sun and the Moon. This alignment creates the perfect geometry for the Sun to fully illuminate the side of the Moon facing Earth. Interestingly, the full moon also coincides with the shortest lunar day. Since the Moon is tidally locked with Earth, the same side always faces us. During a full moon, the Sun illuminates this entire facing side, resulting in a lunar day that lasts as long as an Earth day (roughly 24 hours).

                    Waning Gibbous</h2>
                <div class="moon-info">
                    As the Moon begins its journey back toward the Sun, the opposite side of the Moon now reflects the Moon's light. The lighted side appears to shrink, but the Moon's orbit is simply carrying it out of view from our perspective. The Moon rises later and later each night. The waning gibbous moon signifies another crucial transition period in the lunar cycle. It bridges the gap between the full moon and the third quarter moon. As the Moon continues its orbit, the illuminated area will gradually shrink until it reaches a half-illuminated state (third quarter). During this phase, the waning gibbous moon rises later each night, typically around midnight or even later in the early morning hours. It sets in the late afternoon or early evening, making it visible for a shorter duration compared to the full moon. As the illuminated area of the Moon shrinks during the waning gibbous phase, the gravitational pull on Earth's oceans weakens. This leads to a gradual decrease in tidal heights compared to the peak tides experienced during the full moon.

                <div class="moon-info">
                    The Moon looks like it's half illuminated from the perspective of Earth, but really you're seeing half of the half of the Moon that's illuminated by the Sun ― or a quarter. A last quarter moon, also known as a third quarter moon, rises around midnight and sets around noon.  Unlike the full moon, the last quarter moon offers a good chance to observe earthshine on the dark side. This faint glow is caused by sunlight reflecting off Earth and illuminating the portion of the Moon not directly facing the Sun. As the name suggests, the last quarter moon signifies the Moon being roughly three-quarters of the way through its lunar cycle around Earth. The illuminated area represents the remaining portion of the Moon's face that was fully lit during the recent full moon phase. During this phase, the Sun, Earth, and Moon form another right angle (90 degrees) in space, but with the Moon on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun. This alignment creates the specific geometry for the last quarter's half-illuminated appearance.

                <div class="moon-info">
                    The Moon is nearly back to the point in its orbit where its dayside directly faces the Sun, and all that we see from our perspective is a thin curve. As the Moon progresses through the waning crescent phase, the illuminated crescent becomes progressively thinner and fainter each day. This is because the Moon is continuously orbiting Earth, revealing less and less of its sunlit side from our perspective.  Observing the waning crescent moon can be challenging due to its faintness and its position in the sky. It's typically visible low on the eastern horizon just before sunrise, making it easy to miss if you're not actively looking for it. During this phase, the angle between the Sun, Earth, and Moon is steadily decreasing. As the Moon moves closer to being directly between the Sun and Earth, the illuminated area shrinks, eventually leading to the invisible new moon phase.

                    Earthshine is a dull glow that occurs when sunlight reflects off the Earth and illuminates the dark side of the Moon. This phenomenon is also known as the Moon's ashen glow or the old Moon in the new Moon's arms. Earthshine is most visible a few days before and after a new moon, when the Moon is a thin crescent. The Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight, which then reflects off the Earth and onto the Moon, giving it a faint glow. Earthshine is a beautiful reminder of the interconnectedness of Earth, the Moon, and the Sun.

                    Though the Moon is often thought of as a nighttime visitor, it's also visible during the day as a faint, pale presence. The best times to see a daytime Moon are perhaps during the first and last quarter phases, when the Moon is high enough above the horizon and at about 90 degrees from the Sun in the sky. This helps make the Sun's reflected light bright enough to see as it reflects off of the Moon. The Moon can be seen in the daylit sky at any phase except for the new moon, when it's invisible to us, and full moon, when it's below the horizon during the day. The crescent through quarter phases are high in the sky during the day, but the daytime gibbous phases can be glimpsed only just before the Sun sets.
