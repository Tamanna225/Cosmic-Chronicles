                    <h4>Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, is known for its immense size and swirling cloud bands.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mass: Approximately 318 times that of Earth. If it were a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside</li>
                        <li>Diameter: 142984km. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.</li>
                        <li>Temperature: Ranges from -145 to -108 degrees Celsius</li>
                        <li>Distance: Average distance from the Sun about 484 million miles</li>
                        <li>Gravity: About 2.5 times stronger than Earth's gravity</li>
                        <li>Rings: The rings are composed of small, dark particles, and they are difficult to see except when backlit by the Sun.</li>
                        <li>Speed: Orbits the Sun at about 13.07 km/s</li>
                        <li>Shape: Jupiter is an oblate spheroid. Due to its massive size and rapid rotation, it bulges significantly at the equator and is flattened at the poles.</li>
                        <li>Moons: Jupiter holds the title for the most moons in our solar system, with a whopping 95 known moons and potentially more waiting to be discovered. These moons range in size from tiny moonlets to Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system.</li>
                        <li>Rotation Speed: Jupiter spins very quickly on its axis, completing one full rotation in just under 10 hours (9 hours and 53 minutes). This rapid rotation is a major factor contributing to its oblate shape.</li>
                        <li>Revolution Speed: A year on Jupiter, measured by its revolution around the Sun (sidereal year), is much longer than an Earth year. It takes Jupiter roughly 12 Earth years to complete one full orbit around the Sun.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a massive storm that has been raging for centuries, visible even from Earth.</li>
                        <li>The planet has a faint ring system and about 95 known moons, including the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.</li>
                        <li>Jupiter's composition primarily consists of hydrogen and helium, similar to a small star, leading some to classify it as a "failed star."</li>
                        <li>Studying Jupiter provides insights into planetary formation, the dynamics of gas giants, and the search for exoplanets in other star systems.</li>
